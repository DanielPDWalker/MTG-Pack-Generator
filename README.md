# Info  
* The script will generate a pack based on a set you pass it. 
* Capitilization does not matter. 
* There are a few sets that dont work, but most do.
* The packs are generated in the folder containing the script.
* The script checks how many of each packs are in the folder and increment the counter before the name by 1 automatically.

# Requirements  
You can either use the setup.py file that comes with this project by going to the directory on your computer in CMD or Terminal and typing:
``` 
python setup.py install
```    

Or you can manually install/check you have things you need installed.  
  
In CMD or Terminal, (in any directory, so long as pip is on your path), type each of these on separate lines -  
  
```
pip install requests
```  
```
pip install mtgsdk
```
